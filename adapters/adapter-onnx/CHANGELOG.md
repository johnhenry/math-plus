## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d122aef: Published declarations no longer import `./x.ts` (closes #157). tsc's `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` rewrites `.ts` specifiers to `.js` in emitted JS but not in emitted `.d.ts`, so `dist/*.d.ts` referenced files that aren't in the package, and Deno's type check failed on them. Every package's build now runs `scripts/rewrite-dts-extensions.mjs` after `tsc`:

  - relative `.ts` / `.mts` / `.cts` specifiers in `dist/**/*.d.ts` become `.js` / `.mjs` / `.cjs` (as in laya-js),
  - each `dist/*.js` with a declaration file starts with `// @ts-self-types="./x.d.ts"` (after the `#!` line of a bin), so Deno finds the types when it loads `dist/` as plain files or from a URL instead of through `npm:`. Source maps are shifted by the inserted line.

  No runtime change. The manifest drift test checks every built `dist/` for both.

### Patch Changes

- 80123df: Republish with an npm provenance attestation. The previous versions were published from a local machine on 2026-09-23 without provenance (the CI `NPM_TOKEN` secret had expired). No code changes.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 5d7172b: Lower `engines.node` from `>=26.0.0` to `>=24.0.0`. Nothing in these packages needs Node 26: the full test suite passes on Node 24.9, and CI now tests Node 24. Every suite also runs under Bun 1.2.17 (`npm run test:bun`).

  `@johnhenry/math-plus-frame-parquet`: `scanParquet`/`scanParquetLazy` now accept an absolute file path without wildcards under Bun. Bun 1.2's `fs.promises.glob` returns no matches for such a path, so a pattern with no glob metacharacters is now resolved with `stat` on every runtime.
